Hello World! This is Hitesh here. I graduated with a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka in 2021, and I earned my MSc in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2024. I'm currently a Teaching Assistant in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at NUS.  

I am also actively pursuing a part-time PhD in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering supervised by Dr Rajesh Panicker and co-supervised by Asst. Prof Sheral Tissera and Assoc. Prof Veeravalli Bharadwaj. I also posses a keen interest in FPGA based circuit design, IoT and embedded systems.
